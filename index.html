        <p>Trying to get started but feel like finding a therapist is like trying to get Frank Ocean to release new music? Look no further.</p>
        <details>
          <summary> “How do I find a therapist?" </summary>
          <p>Google, your insurance website, or my favorite: 
            <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists">psychology today's therapist finder tool</a> </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary> "There’s more than one kind of therapy?" </summary>
          <p>Yes. Welcome to my alphabet soup:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) – highly recommended for many things, it can be done online and it focuses on recognizing and then changing destructive/distorted thought patterns</li>
            <li>EMDR (Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) – the “sounds weird but ok” of therapy that uses visual, auditory, or physical signals to help reprocess emotions and memories, it's highly recommended for trauma and sometimes anxiety; caution: can be triggering</li>
            <li>DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) – this helps treat many things as well, teaches skills to help control emotion and resolve conflicts, and is notably effective for borderline personality disorder</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There's more, but these are some of the most common and effective (Shoutout to <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/think-well/201603/and-the-three-best-therapy-methods-are">exposure therapy and behavioral therapy</a> as well). In your initial phone call/email to a therapist, ask about what they might recommend for you. The therapist might recommend you to someone else who may help you better, and it may take several therapists before you find the right one - don't be afraid to ask for recommendations or <a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/7-tips-for-changing-therapists/">change therapists</a>, especially if your insurance stops covering yours.</p>

          <summary> "What about medication? Side effects?" </summary>
          <p>There are many classes of antidepressants. Since I don’t think I can legally give medical advice, 
            talk to your general practitioner if they’re a good listener. If not, Dr. Google may be able to help. 
            People loooove to talk about their antidepressants online. However, remember that every body and every brain is different, so no matter what other people say, your results can and will vary!</p>

          <summary> "How does any of this work with insurance? Will my parents know?" </summary>
          <p>If you have insurance, check your insurer’s website for their terms; they may limit the amount or length of visits they cover. You will usually pay a co-pay of anywhere from $20 up to the low $40s, <i>max</i>.</p>
          <p>If you do not have insurance, therapists will usually work with you on a sliding scale, though it’s worth looking for community centers or universities near that may provide low-cost therapy or research studies that involve therapy.</p>
          <p>Parents – this <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/28/483836497/states-offer-privacy-protection-for-young-adults-on-parents-health-plan">article</a> explains it better than I can!</p>

          <summary> Campus resources @ UMich</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>CAPS (<a href="https://caps.umich.edu/content/when-can-i-be-seen">link</a>) – more like triage, but if you’re lower income this may be the best option; this page summarizes their schedules/services and lists the next available appointment time </li>
            <li>UHS – a good general practitioner can prescribe antidepressants and work with you through the side effects and adjustment period</li>
            <li>Mindfulness @ Umich (<a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/advising/stay-on-track/staying-motivated/mindfulness.html">link</a>) – learning and practicing mindfulness decreases stress and improves brain function</li>
            <li>Wolverine Support Network (<a href="https://www.umichwsn.org/">link</a>) – just a group where u talk about things</li>
          </ul>

        <p>So you’re feeling stressed, upset, overwhelmed, anxious, or maybe empty… Early adulthood is often when people are first diagnosed with mental illnesses - it's a tough time. The first year of college is the most common time for a first clinical depressive episode, often in response to sudden changes in environment, since no matter how positive a change is, all changes cause stress. Brains function differently as a response to stress – sometimes in a way that is negative. Many adverse reactions are actually a product of social and economic factors in combination with biological ones. It's not an issue of being weak. It's a normal response.</p>
