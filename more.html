        <h5>More info</h5>
        <p>Hi welcome to the weirdest annotated bibliography I've ever written! These links and their descriptions are for those of you who can make time to read these without sacrificing sleep or other obligations. If you're reading this AND it's too late, please go to sleep.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>More information on therapy, meds, $$$, alternatives, etc.
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://time.com/money/4607786/mental-health-costs-resources-help/">A Comprehensive Guide to the Best Mental Health Resources</a>: Basically what I did on the Resources page, but longer and more in depth, with information on <b>medication discounts, insurance rights and problems, and a ton of links to other info.</b></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>: the mindfulness app that I've used before and liked! It comes with some free sessions that are permanently available (though you have to pay to get more variety) and can be used via iPhone, Android, or via a computer using its very own website. Many other guided mindfulness apps and videos exist, and the practice of mindfulness itself has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety, among other things.</li>
              <li>I don't have a link for this, but if you're looking for a sign to exercise and get some sunshine, this is it. [very Shia LaBeouf voice] Just do it!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Anthropology & Mental Health (or, why am I like this pt. 2)
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/">Hallucinatory 'voices' shaped by local culture, Stanford anthropologist says</a>: In our culture, one major symptom of schizophrenia involves hearing intimidating voices, right? So, why does the same condition manifest as the voice of God to Ghanaians and as friends' and family members’ voices to Indians? People with schizophrenia in one culture describe voices as intrusive, violent strangers, yet others are getting divine advice or just reminders to do chores. It’s the same condition, so the key to this difference lies in cultural perception and norms; where we perceive hearing voices to be Bad and a Medical Problem to Solve, few in the other cultures we’ve talked about see it as a disease – instead, voices may be attributed to to the environment, or they have identities for the voices instead of perceiving them as signs of Oh Shit Something Is Wrong. The good news? Even in our culture, developing relationships between the voices and the person with the condition assuages the voices and sweetens them.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/anthropology-and-mental-health-care/7CD363516114112C337CBBA6416ABA59/core-reader">Anthropology and mental health care</a>: A summary of the limits of the purely biological model in a global context and the factors it excludes - with suggestions on how to make mental health care more effective. Skip this if you get anxious reading about the world's problems.</li>
              <li><a href="https://marciainhorn.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/Kleinman.pdf">Medical Anthropology and Mental Health: Five Questions for the Next Fifty Years</a>: The entire paper is a good but dense read, especially if you – like me – have exactly 0.15 amount of background in anthropology. It's ok not to know things - ask questions! Learn! If you're on this page, you're already a nerd (we love to see it).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Info relevant to college students (Yes, it's very normal. Yes, you can do something about it.)
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://library.osu.edu/ojs/index.php/BHAC/article/view/6056/4807">Mental Health on University Campuses and the Needs of Students They Seek to Serve</a>.: “86% of college students report feeling overwhelmed by their responsibilities; 57% experience substantial anxiety; almost 35% describe feeling so depressed that it becomes difficult to function; and approximately 66% suffer academically due to either depression, anxiety or stress.” College-age people are the least likely to seek help, due to: long wait times, identity/disability stigma, time constraints, wanting to feel independent, and not knowing about resources. Consequences include dropping out and struggling with academics/work. Getting students to counseling helps; however, universities struggle with staff funding and burnout, and other methods may reach more students. What else works: supported education (aka <b>talking to your teachers and working with them</b> to figure out how you can best succeed within the class framework), more funds for more programming.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.okhighered.org/campus-safety/resources/CBP-mental-best-practices-higher-ed.pdf">Best practices for Mental Health Services in Colleges and Universities</a>.: Substance abuse is another factor in mental health treatment on college campuses. An overall plan should include: having crisis protocols and enough services on and off campus; integration of screening and care into visits to general practitioners/obgyns; identifying students who need help but don't reach out; providing anonymous online counseling; facilitating higher quality social connections; and better disability accomodations and screening.</li>
              <li><a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/40221479">Help-Seeking and Access to Mental Health Care in a University Student Population</a>: <b>Informal support groups</b> may help improve campus mental health, as may educational and awareness campaigns, since one reason people may not seek help is that they don’t believe treatment will be very effective. Also, though socioeconomic status obviously affects who can seek help, students from lower SES backgrounds are still less likely to receive help, even when university services are free (so if you're #notrich, this is your personal encouragement to schedule an appointment).
