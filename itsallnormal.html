        <h5>"Why am I like this?"</h5>
        <p>Also known as "What’s happening to me? Is there something wrong with me?" or "I've tried so many things, why isn't anything working?"</p>
        <p>These are good questions, and it gets messy:</p>
        <p>So you’ve probably heard that your brain cells are functioning differently, or that your neurotransmitters are [Hannibal Buress voice] *WACK* and while that is valid and true, that’s not all. Biology is not the be all-end all.
        *substance abuse example*
        </p>
        <p> In fact, there's a term for how mental illness is often a response to sociological factors: social suffering. Let's break this down:</p>
        <p>"The term “social suffering” was coined […] to emphasize how ordinary social life everywhere is experienced as pain and suffering at least as much as joy and happiness, and that such collective pain and suffering is normative and normal […]. [The term also refers] to extraordinary human experience from the social consequences of individual catastrophes to collective disasters.” - Arthur Kleinman MD., Professor of Medical Anthropology at Harvard University (<a href="https://marciainhorn.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/Kleinman.pdf">text source</a>)</p>
        <p>So again, factors like income, culture, media, politics, and life experiences influence your mental health just as much as biology does. The rest of your body responds to changes in response to stimuli (you shiver when your body temperature drops, you feel dizzy if you don’t eat), so why wouldn’t your brain freak out in response to unusually stressful situations? We’re talking in analogies here, but sometimes you have to raise the room temperature – or change the situation. Whether than means changing lifestyle choices (university major, career path, substance usage, physical activity, school/social environment, etc.) or utilizing the very useful tools of medication and therapy to adjust both internal and external factors, these are healthy solutions to a normal, if painful, physical response.</p>
        <p><b>So are you mentally ill or is it just #society?</b></p>
        <p><b>The two are interconnected.</b> What is labeled as mentally healthy changes depending on the current cultural and political fattitudes of the day. In the end, just do what works for you and life goals.</p>

          <p><i>Disclaimer: this dialogue has been modified to protect privacy.</i></p>

          <p>I was sitting across the table from my friend, ready to type. “So do you wanna talk about your own experiences?”</p>
          <p>He hesitates. “Yeah.” A pause, then he starts.</p>
          <p>“When you do enough drugs and alcohol, it starts affecting your mental status. It gets exhausting over time. You start it as a coping mechanism for the anxiety of new situations, to fit in, especially when you’re surrounded by rich kids, or kids that come from families that drink too much with them. Lawyer and doctor parents as well. I’ve seen my friends’ parents almost black out. And you keep doing it, all the time, and it affects your ability to be sober and still feel enjoyment. It gets dark, and you don’t want to be there anymore… <br />
It gets healthy when the situation changes. You come home for the summer. You start being able to predict it and look for a way out. Knowing your social group is changing soon, you also start changing and looking for new things. So, finding something like yoga – it provided me with a new social group, gave me personal goals, personal development, and delivered some endorphins. It was situational addiction, and I’ve found a happy medium now.”</p>
