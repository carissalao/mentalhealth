        <p>So you’ve probably heard that your brain cells are functioning differently, or that your neurotransmitters are [Hannibal Buress voice] *WACK* and while that is valid and true, that’s not all. Biology is not the be all-end all.

        <p> In fact, there's a term for how mental illness is often a response to sociological factors: social suffering. Let's break this down:</p>
        <p>"The term “social suffering” was coined […] to emphasize how ordinary social life everywhere is experienced as pain and suffering at least as much as joy and happiness, and that such collective pain and suffering is normative and normal […]. [The term also refers] to extraordinary human experience from the social consequences of individual catastrophes to collective disasters.” - Arthur Kleinman MD., Professor of Medical Anthropology at Harvard University (<a href="https://marciainhorn.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/Kleinman.pdf">text source</a>)</p>

          <summary> On schizophrenia. </summary>
          <p>Let’s take schizophrenia: in our culture, one major symptom involves hearing threatening voices, and it’s generally considered a tough diagnosis to receive or to care for, right? So, why does the same condition manifest as the voice of God to Ghanaians and as family members’ voices to Indians? People with schizophrenia in one culture describe voices as intrusive, violent strangers, yet others are getting divine advice or reminders to do chores. It’s the same condition, so the key to this difference lies in cultural perception and norms; where we perceive hearing voices to be Bad and a Medical Problem to Solve, few in the other cultures we’ve talked about see it as a disease – instead, they have identities for the voices instead of perceiving them as signs of Oh Shit Something Is Wrong. The good news? Developing relationships between the voices and the person with the condition assuages the voices and sweetens them.</p>

        <p>So again, factors like income, culture, media, politics, and life experiences influence your mental health just as much as biology does. The rest of your body responds to changes in response to stimuli (you shiver when your body temperature drops, you feel dizzy if you don’t eat), so why wouldn’t your brain freak out in response to unusually stressful situations? We’re talking in analogies here, but sometimes you have to raise the room temperature – or change the situation. Whether than means changing lifestyle choices (university major, career path, substance usage, physical activity, school/social environment, etc.) or utilizing the very useful tools of medication and therapy to adjust both internal and external factors, these are healthy solutions to a normal, if painful, physical response.</p>
        <p><b>So are you mentally ill or is it just #society?</b></p>
        <p><b>The two are interconnected.</b> What is labeled as mentally healthy changes depending on the current cultural and political fattitudes of the day. In the end, just do what works for you and life goals.</p>
