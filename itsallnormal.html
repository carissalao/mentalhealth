        <h5>"Why am I like this?"</h5>
        <p>Also known as "What’s happening to me? Is there something wrong with me?" or "I've tried so many things, why isn't anything working?"</p>
        <p>These are good questions, and it gets messy:</p>
        <p>So you’ve probably heard that your brain cells are functioning differently, or that your neurotransmitters are [Hannibal Buress voice] *WACK* and while that is valid and true, that’s not all. Biology is not the be all-end all. In fact, there's a term for how mental illness is often a response to sociological factors: social suffering. Let's break this down:</p>
        <p>"The term “social suffering” was coined […] to emphasize how ordinary social life everywhere is experienced as pain and suffering at least as much as joy and happiness, and that such collective pain and suffering is normative and normal […]. [The term also refers] to extraordinary human experience from the social consequences of individual catastrophes to collective disasters.” - Arthur Kleinman MD., Professor of Medical Anthropology at Harvard University (<a href="https://marciainhorn.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/Kleinman.pdf">text source</a>)</p>
        <p>Factors like income, culture, media, politics, and life experiences influence your mental health just as much as biology does. The rest of your body responds to changes in response to stimuli (ex. you shiver when your body temperature drops), so why wouldn’t your brain freak out in response to unusually stressful situations? We’re talking in analogies here, but sometimes you have to raise the room temperature – or change the situation. Whether that means changing lifestyle choices (university major, career path, substance usage, physical activity, school/social environment, etc.) or utilizing the very useful tools of medication and therapy to adjust both internal and external factors, these are healthy solutions to a normal, if painful, physical response.</p>
        <p><b>So are you mentally ill or is it just #society?</b></p>
        <p><b>The two are interconnected.</b> What is labeled as mentally healthy changes depending on the current cultural and political attitudes of the day. In the end, just do what works for you and your life goals.</p>

          <p><i>Disclaimer: this dialogue has been modified to protect privacy.</i></p>
          <p>I sit across the table from my friend, ready to type. “So do you wanna talk about your own experiences?”</p>
          <p>He hesitates. “Yeah.” A pause, then he starts.</p>
          <p>“When you do enough drugs and alcohol, it starts affecting your mental status. It gets exhausting over time. You start it as a coping mechanism for the anxiety of new situations, to fit in, especially when you’re surrounded by rich kids, or kids that come from families that drink too much with them. Lawyer and doctor parents as well. I’ve seen my friends’ parents almost black out. And you keep doing it, all the time, and it affects your ability to be sober and still feel enjoyment. It gets dark, and you don’t want to be there anymore… <br />
It gets healthy when the situation changes. You come home for the summer. You start being able to predict it and look for a way out. Knowing your social group is changing soon, you also start changing and looking for new things. So, finding something like yoga – it provided me with a new social group, gave me personal goals, personal development, and delivered some endorphins. It was a situational addiction, and I’ve found a happy medium now.”</p>

                <summary>On immigrant experiences.</summary>
                <p><i>Disclaimer: details have been modified to protect privacy.</i></p>
                <p>"My parents are undocumented, so I was too scared to talk about issues at home growing up, and - the immigration process is so long - when we had problems getting their legal status, the stress from that and from constantly experiencing discrimination contributed a lot to my mental health decline."<br />
                "When I was 6, my parents snuck me through the Canadian border. I wrote my college essays about being undocumented, and the results were... rough. I had to take time off school to really figure things out. It wasn't what I expected out of the work I put in and results I got during high school."<br />
                "I avoid going home over breaks. Like, I think I'm literally too scared to. I love my baba, but he never says he's proud of me. Always so much criticism. Yelling. Sometimes I can't handle it, because I love him so much and just want to make him proud."</p>
              <p>The immigrant experience manifests in different ways. Maybe you're haunted by the sacrifices your parents made, or you're stressed from people assuming that you're less intelligent or that you only got where you were because of Affirmative Action. Maybe you feel like you can't live up to their (or your) standards or like you're too _____ to be American and too American to be _____. I hear that, and so do a lot of people - these are all the experiences of my friends, who provide just one snapshot of the immigrant experience overall. What a lot of us have found helpful: therapy or community. Community for the understanding and support it brings. Therapy for the rest.</p>
              <p>"After a few sessions, my new therapist began a sentence with, “Okay, so when you experienced some emotional abuse as a child–" and I just blinked and cut in with a, “I wasn’t emotio – ah,“ and just sat there for a minute. She was right, even if my parents had changed and had stopped threatening to deport me to Vietnam years ago (I speak two words of Vietnamese, and they are: "fish sauce"). A bunch of my friends of various backgrounds had the same experiences with threats for deportation to the motherlands, constant criticism or yelling, etc. For our problems, we alternately laughed together or listened to, comforted, and advised each other for all the ones which we couldn't laugh at.</p>
              <p>So you finally process your childhood and learn skills to confront the resulting anxiety (or whatever you have) about life, and you find strength in a community that gets it, understands the stigma, and believes in you and themselves. Since fluctuations in mental health are normal, one of the best resources you can have is a social network that supports you and treats these varying, common human experiences as normal. That’s really what this is about: community. </p>
