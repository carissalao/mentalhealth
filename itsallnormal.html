        <p>Ok first of all, good question. Very good question, and it gets messy:</p>
        <p>So you’ve probably heard that your brain cells are functioning differently, and while that is valid and true, that’s not all. Biology is not the be all-end all.

          <summary> On schizophrenia. </summary>
          <p>•	Let’s take schizophrenia: in our culture, one major symptom involves hearing threatening voices, and it’s generally considered a tough diagnosis to receive or to care for, right? So, why does the same condition manifest as the voice of God to Ghanaians and as family members’ voices to Indians? People with schizophrenia in one culture describe voices as intrusive, violent strangers, yet others are getting divine advice or reminders to do chores. It’s the same condition, so the key to this difference lies in cultural perception and norms; where we perceive hearing voices to be Bad and a Medical Problem to Solve, few in the other cultures we’ve talked about see it as a disease – instead, they have identities for the voices instead of perceiving them as signs of Oh Shit Something Is Wrong. The good news? Developing relationships between the voices and the person with the condition assuages the voices and sweetens them. But so how does this relate to you?  </p>
